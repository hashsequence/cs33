first I went into GDB
gdb src/thttpd-no

I set a breakpoint at read_config

step until while ( fgets( line, 1000, fp ) != (char*) 0 )

look at the stack pointer which was 
the beggining of the pointer to line since it holds the buffer
 and it was
0x7fffffffcf40 


I step through until fclose
and the rsp was 0x7fffffffcfd8 
took the difference and it was -152 from 0x...f40
here are my calculates at the addresses I will be using 

0x7fffffffcf40 at the beggining 0
0x7fffffffcfd8 at the end -152
0x7fffffffcfe0 -160
0x7fffffffcf40 -171
