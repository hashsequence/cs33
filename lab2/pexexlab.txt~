Here are my GDB notes from discussion
(gdp) b main  sets breakpoint in main

(gdb) list    list the source code

(gdb) set args 3   
(gdb) run
(gdb) info register    dumps info on register    
(gdb) disassemble         keep pressing disassemble to go to the next part

(gdb) step        step is alot in assembly code

(gdb) si     gives you next assembly line


{add}{func + off}{filename:line#}
{instr} {reg/mem efect}

(gdb) p $rax
$1 = 3
(gdb) p/x $rax
$2 = 0x3
(gdb) p/d &rax
(gdb) p $rip
$3 = 3

gdb --args path/to/executable -every -arg you can=think < of



disasessemble-next-line on

this command will show the disassembled code while I step through

b Ftimes wil put a break in the beggining of the Ftimes function

si or stepi will step through each instruction

info registers

this will give me the content of the registers

===================================================
GATHERING INSTRUCTION TRACES
==================================================

FIRST I made a shell script:

#!/bin/sh

gdb --args ~eggert/bin64/bin/emacs-24.5 -batch -eval '(print (* 6997 -439804231\
6799 179))'

this opens emacs-24.5 in gdb  with the argument 

this script was put into the file e24

steps I took:

1) ./e24
(
gdb --args ~eggert/bin64/bin/emacs-24.5 -batch -eval '(print (* 6997 -439804231\
6799 179))'
)

2)set disassemble-next-line on
3)b Ftimes
4)set logging on
5)r
6)si
7)info register

I repreated si and occassionaly used info register to see changes in the registry
until the end of the arith-driver

then I made another shell script with the command

| grep "=>.*" | sed "s/=> /g" > trace.tr

to filter out only the traces I want

===============================================
EXAMINING INTEGER OVERFLOW HANDLING
===============================================
first i copied the c source code and compiled with the 3 commands:

1) gcc -O2 -S ovf.c
2) gcc -O2 -fsanitize=undefined ovf.c
3) gcc -O2 -fwrapv ovf.c

//look at testovf.txt for analysis


=========================================
A FEW MORE QUESTIONS
=========================================
1) I ran the argument on GDB -batch -eval '(print (* 6997 -4398042316799 179))'
and I got:                 -896699255797638033
but the correct answer is: -5508385274225025937  
so clearly this is the wrong answer, so I looked through my traced that
was run with this argument and I paid atention to the rdi, rsi,rbx, rax 
registers 
I ran the program in GDB with Watch Points,
int a certain line I got rbx as -30773102090642603
then it was multiplied by 179 that was currently in the rdi register
and got ,-5508385274225025937 but then there were 
some cmp and jmp instructions, which corresponds to the test cases
when there are integer overflows, which handles the cases of overflow
which of course changes the value


this was lines I was examining:
Watchpoint 5: $rbx
Old value = -30773102090642603
New value = -5508385274225025937
0x0000000000541f44 <arith_driver+580>:  e9 87 fe ff ff  jmpq   0x541dd0 <arith_driver+208>
0x0000000000541dd0 <arith_driver+208>:  49 8d 6f 01     lea    0x1(%r15),%rbp
0x0000000000541dd4 <arith_driver+212>:  48 39 e9        cmp    %rbp,%rcx
0x0000000000541dd7 <arith_driver+215>:  0f 8e 1d 01 00 00       jle    0x541efa <arith_driver+506>
0x0000000000541efa <arith_driver+506>:  48 8d 04 9d 00 00 00 00 lea    0x0(,%rbx,4),%rax
Watchpoint 7: $rax
Old value = -51527218082987776
New value = -3586797023190552132
0x0000000000541f02 <arith_driver+514>:  48 83 c4 28     add    $0x28,%rsp
0x0000000000541f06 <arith_driver+518>:  5b      pop    %rbx
Watchpoint 5: $rbx
Old value = -5508385274225025937
New value = 140737488345272


the rbx is never stored in rax so b/c there was an integer overflow
since the biggest fix num is 2305843009213693951


2)If I convert  2305843009213693951 into hex I get 0x1fffffffffffffff      
basically emacs lisp uses the least significant 62 bytes to store the value

In a trace I gatherd using most-positive-fixnum I got:

0x0000000000541da1 <arith_driver+161>:  48 c1 ff 02     sar    $0x2,%rdi
Watchpoint 2: $rdi
Old value = 9223372036854775804
New value = 2305843009213693951

It seems it shifts the value of 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF by 2 
to get 0x1FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF

I looked in the data.c file to find the most-positive-fixnum, then
I looked into lisp.h to find the defined valuue of most-positive-fixnum and got this:

MOST_POSITIVE_FIXNUM (EMACS_INT_MAX >> INTTYPEBITS)

3)

I used GDB to emacs  -batch -eval '(print (* most-positive-fixnum most-positive-fixnum))'
and here is the info register I am looking at:
 info register
rax            0x0      0
rbx            0x1fffffffffffffff       2305843009213693951
rcx            0x2      2
rdx            0x3      3
rsi            0x2      2
rdi            0x1fffffffffffffff       2305843009213693951

In the traces this is what I was looking at:

0x0000000000541e65 <arith_driver+357>:  48 0f af fb     imul   %rbx,%rdi
Watchpoint 2: $rdi
Old value = 2305843009213693951
New value = -4611686018427387903
0x0000000000541e69 <arith_driver+361>:  48 bb ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 3f   movabs $0x3fffffffffffffff,%rbx
Watchpoint 6: $rbx
Old value = 2305843009213693951
New value = 4611686018427387903
0x0000000000541e73 <arith_driver+371>:  48 21 fb        and    %rdi,%rbx
Watchpoint 6: $rbx
Old value = 4611686018427387903
New value = 1

basing on what I see the values in rdi and rsi was and together 
and the value yield 1
